# 4_bit_alu
Implementation of ALU using RTL to GDSII flow.

Here we are doing implementation of 4-bit ALU(Arthematic logical unit) using RTL (Register
transfer level) to GDSII (Graphic design system II) stream. we are usign the QFlow VSD Open Source EDA Tools.

here is the block diagram representation of an Arthematic logical unit (ALU).
